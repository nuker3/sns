      <p>YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report, comment on videos,
        and subscribe to other users. It offers a wide variety of user-generated
        and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short
        and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging,

        YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users can only watch videos on the site,

        add comments to videos.

        YouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, who were all early employees of PayPal.
        Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim
        studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
        According to a story that has often been repeated in the media,
        Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after
        they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that
        had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco.
        Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred,
        but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party
        "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story
        that was very digestible"
